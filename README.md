# Project: jQuery and the DOM

Working with events by building a Snake game for The Odin Project's [Project: jQuery and the DOM](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/jquery-and-the-dom)

1. The game board is a simple grid of 40x40 squares.
2. Keep score -- each food is worth more points the longer your snake is.
3. Speed up -- the game speeds up slightly with each food consumed.
